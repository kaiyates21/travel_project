    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This website is a personal project created to showcase the top five places I want to travel to in the world. Each location has a unique personal or cultural meaning to me, and building this site allowed me to combine storytelling with design. I chose Monte Carlo for its luxury and famous casino; the Vatican for its deep religious and historical significance; Tokyo for its high-tech urban energy and Japanese food; Nicaragua because of my family roots and heritage; and Dubai for its modern innovation and architecture.</p>

    <p>Throughout this project, I learned how to manually code a multi-page website using HTML and CSS. I organized the site with folders, used relative paths, added navigation links, and styled everything using one external stylesheet. I also made sure to include alt text on images, use semantic tags, and keep my design consistent. One challenge I had was getting images to load correctly and fixing the file structure to work with GitHub Pages. Once I figured out how to upload files to the root directory and link them properly, everything came together.</p>

    <p>Publishing the site on GitHub Pages taught me how to deploy a working project and share it online. I’m proud of the clean layout and feel more confident in my web development skills. This project also gave me an appreciation for accessibility and UX best practices, which I made sure to apply with alt tags and contrast-checked colors. It’s exciting to see something I built from scratch now live on the web.</p>
